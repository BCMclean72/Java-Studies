When I run my runner class with a size not too much larger than
10000 I get a Stack Overflow exception when I try to add keys in
increasing order in the Map. This is likely due to the many
recursive calls that my insert method performs. 
To improve on this it might be useful to use the upper or lower
bound methods. There may be a way to find a node near to where I want
to add the key and then insert from there insert from there instead
of inserting from the root.
This could have the result of reducing some of the recursion.
Aside from that however my others calls were fairly close to the
time that Java's tree map took. Because of this, I stand by my
original decision to use a BST. I believe the array would have
performed much more slowly.
